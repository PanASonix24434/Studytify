Studytify is a web-based platform tailored for students, inspired by Spotify, that creates study-friendly environments through curated music playlists. The application allows users to give feedback and request new songs, enhancing interactivity and engagement. It features admin functionalities to manage the songs database (add, remove, update) and includes security measures to protect user data. This project was developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and tools like XAMPP and phpMyAdmin, showcasing my capabilities in secured web programming and user interface design.
